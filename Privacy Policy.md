# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This privacy policy explains the data handling practices of the **Recover Closed Tab** Chrome extension. This extension is designed to restore recently closed browser tabs, offering options to customize the extension icon and methods for reopening closed tabs. We value your privacy and strive to maintain transparency about the limited data our extension handles.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Locally Stored Data
The extension stores certain data locally on your device to support its tab restoration functionality:
- **Tab URLs**: When a tab is closed, the extension saves its URL to local storage to allow future restoration. These URLs are stored solely on your device and are not transmitted externally.

### Settings and Preferences
User preferences, such as the selected tab restoration method and custom icon settings, are saved to local storage on your device to enhance the extension’s functionality. This information is not transmitted to any external servers.

## Advertising

The **Recover Closed Tab** extension includes an optional advertising section, visible within the options page. This section links to an external website related to the creator's business. 
- **Disable Advertising**: Users may disable the advertising section at any time by clicking the close button on the ad. Once closed, the ad section will remain hidden until re-enabled by reinstalling the extension or manually modifying settings.

## Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions:
- **sessions**: To retrieve recently closed tabs and support tab restoration.
- **tabs**: To interact with open and closed tabs, enabling custom tab recovery behavior.
- **storage**: To save user preferences, tab URLs, and settings locally on your device.

These permissions are essential to the core functions of the extension and are not used to collect or transmit personal information.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

The **Recover Closed Tab** extension does not share any data with third parties. All data collected or generated by the extension is stored locally on your device and remains under your control.

## Security Measures

We prioritize the security of your data and use Chrome’s storage API to ensure that saved data is isolated to your browser’s local storage. However, we recommend exercising caution with URLs that contain sensitive information, as they may be saved locally for tab restoration purposes.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes to the extension’s functionality or data handling practices. Users will be notified of significant changes through the Chrome Web Store page.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or data handling practices, please reach out to the developer.
